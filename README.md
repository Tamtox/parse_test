- [ ] Install the dependencies:
```
npm ci
```
- [ ] Go to the directory `src/tasks/` and examine the js-files inside. Each of them includes one task to be resolved
- [ ] Go to the directory `__tests__` and examine by what way the functions in js-files will be invoking
- [ ] Read the commented instructions in tasks js-files, and try to find a solution by writing your code instead of `// your solution here`
- [ ] You can supplement any other functions as you wish
- [ ] You can install any other packages, instead thw cases when certain package use is strictly required
- [ ] Verify your code performance, when you are ready:
```
npm run test
```
- [ ] When all tests are passed, run the linter and fix unresolved issues, if you get them:
```
npm run lint
```
- [ ] Commit your changes and push them into Gitlab
